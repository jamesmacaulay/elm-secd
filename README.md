# elm-secd

This is an implementation of Peter Landin's SECD machine, as described his 1964 paper [The Mechanical Evaluation of Expressions](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/user/crary/www/819-f09/Landin64.pdf).

You can play around with the implementation at http://jamesmacaulay.github.io/elm-secd.

I took a lot of inspiration from [this Haskell implementation](http://shift-reset.com/blog/2013/2/18/A%20Toy%20SECD%20Machine/), which was quite helpful in trying to understand Landin's paper.
